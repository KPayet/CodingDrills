#Union-Find

From Wikipedia: "A Union-Find data structure, also called a disjoint-set data structure, is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (nonoverlapping) subsets. It supports two useful operations:

* Find: Determine which subset a particular element is in.
* Union: Join two subsets into a single subset.

This data structure is useful to keep track of the connected components of an undirected graph, for example. That's why I put it in the Graphs subfolder.

It will be used for example in the implementation of the Kruskal Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm
