<h3>Stack</h3>

Implementation of a simple Stack class.
The implementation is linked list based, and I use the LinkedList class in the CodingDrills folder.

Most of the work is actually performed by the private LinkedList member of the Queue instance.
The Queue class pretty much simply enforces the FIFO access typical for queues, which makes the implementation pretty short and simple.

Note: 
The class has been tested with valgrind for memory leaks, and no problem was found.
