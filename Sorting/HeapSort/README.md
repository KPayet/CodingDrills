#HeapSort

Implementation of HeapSort.
This implementation reuses the elements from the priority queue implementation (see ../PriorityQueue/).

Mergesort and Quicksort are almost always prefered over Heapsort, because they are usually faster, easier to parallelize and have better cache usage.

However, heapsort can be useful when the code size is important, since it is implemented in a very few line of codes.
